Introduction
The notebook Fraud detection on credit card.ipynb showcases the step-by-step process of detecting fraudulent transactions in credit card data. It employs various techniques, including data analysis, undersampling, and logistic regression modeling, to identify and predict fraudulent activities.

Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project contains information on credit card transactions, distinguishing between normal and fraudulent transactions. It includes features like transaction amounts, time, and other anonymized variables.

Data Preprocessing
The notebook covers essential data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, exploring the data distribution, under-sampling to balance the dataset, and preparing the data for model training.

Model Building and Evaluation
The project utilizes logistic regression for fraud detection. It involves training the model on the prepared dataset and evaluating its performance using accuracy scores on both training and test data.

Usage
To use this project:

Clone or download the repository.
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
Open and run the Fraud detection on credit card.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment or Google Colab.
